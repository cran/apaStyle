Description: Most psychological journals require that tables in a manuscript comply to APA (American Association of Psychology) standards. Creating APA tables manually is often time consuming and prone to transcription errors. This package generates tables for MS Word ('.docx' extension) in APA format automatically with just a few lines of code.
