Description: Most psychological journals require that tables in a manuscript
    comply to APA (American Association of Psychology) standards. Creating APA
    tables manually is often time consuming and prone to transcription errors.
    This package generates tables for MS Word ('.docx' extension) in APA format
    automatically with just a few lines of code.
